Check out the deployed Heroku-version of this app at [tweether.io](http://www.tweether.io) (the initial page load might be slow since it's hosted on a free tier)

## Running locally

First, make sure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) installed on your computer.

Clone the repo, then run the following commands in the folder:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

All the data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that signing up and posting tweets costs a small amount of ether. This is probably not something that people would be willing to pay for in the near future, but serves as a proof-of-concept.
